## This is an example on how to create your own schema definition. Include it in cable.rb

# module Schema
#  require 'cable/schema/faceable'
# end


# module Schemata
#   #Influenced by devise's schema module. Methods defined here will be available within migartion files to apply a schema concept.
#   module Schema
# 
#       # Provides a common set of address fields such as, street_address_1, street_address_2, city, state, zip_code and country as String fields.
#       def faceable
#         apply_schema :face, String
#         apply_schema :eyes, String
#       end
#     
#     end
# end
#
